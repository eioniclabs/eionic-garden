# Simulation Logs: Enhanced Sensitivity Model

These logs represent the Enhanced Model, where Sensitivity
organically exceeds 1.0, producing a hyper-reactive state
that the engine sustains without loss of coherence.
Sensitivity values in this dataset reach up to 1.35+.

Twelve log files cover the full 11,557-tick run (~950 ticks
per file, except the final file). Three avatars (BlueY,
OrangeZ, GreenX) ran under identical external conditions
throughout.

Note: INIT blocks (512-dim trait vectors) have been redacted 
from all log files per Eionic Research Initiative data handling 
protocol. Hormone trajectories and action logs are preserved 
as recorded.

### Log Structure (per tick entry)

Each tick records the following per avatar:
- Hormones: cortisol, dopamine, serotonin, oxytocin, adrenaline,
  testosterone, endorphins, melatonin
- Fatigue, Energy delta, Sensitivity (may exceed 1.0)
- Rest drive
- Action selected and associated cost

### Key Characteristics: Enhanced Sensitivity Model

1. **Sensitivity Above 1.0:** The defining feature of this 
   dataset. Sensitivity peaks at 1.30+ in sustained phases, 
   indicating the avatar is operating in a state where internal 
   hormonal signals are amplified beyond the conservative 
   homeostatic envelope.

2. **Coherence Under Hyper-Reactivity:** Despite sensitivity 
   exceeding the normalized ceiling, avatars remain functionally 
   coherent — action selection continues, hormonal cycles 
   persist, and personality signatures remain individually 
   distinct. This is the central observation this dataset 
   demonstrates.

3. **Avatar Survival Under Stress:** No avatar enters a 
   degenerate state (action lock, hormonal flatline, or 
   indefinite Wait loop) during high-sensitivity phases. 
   The engine's feedback architecture absorbs the amplified 
   reactivity without breaking simulation integrity.

4. **Personality Ordering Preserved:** Inter-avatar rank 
   ordering of diagnostic actions (Confront, Withdraw, Think) 
   is maintained throughout the enhanced run, consistent with 
   the baseline model. Expanded sensitivity amplifies behavioral 
   expression; it does not erase blueprint-seeded identity.

### Relation to Published Paper

These logs are the primary data source for Tables 1–4 in 
*Bounded Stochastic Agency* (Eionic Research Initiative, 2026). 
The 11,557-tick run documented here is the dataset from which 
action distributions, diversity entropy, and cortisol divergence 
metrics were computed.

### Note on Sensitivity > 1.0

Sensitivity in the Eionic engine is not a hard-capped normalized 
variable in the enhanced model. Values above 1.0 represent 
an intentional parameter expansion to test the outer envelope 
of the P4 VEE's homeostatic feedback. It is not a bug or 
calibration error. The baseline model (see `/data/baseline_model`) 
provides the < 1.0 control condition for direct comparison.
